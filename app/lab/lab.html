                <div class="description">This is a replay of Game 4 between former world champion Lee Sedol and AlphaGo. AlphaGo resigns a dozen moves after move 78 which broke AlphaGo's neural network. The background visualizes the song "the Best Move". The styling broke after a major update to my SASS framework. Rather than fixing this, I hope to use what I learned from this to build a better music visualizer, and an online joseki dictionary. Refresh stops the music.</div>
