As I learn more from work and personal projects, I hope apply those skills to ideas I previously wasn't ready to execute. In gamer terms, it's like a skill tree of sorts.</p>

            <h4 class="section-subheading">Current</h4>
            <p class="section-text">I like everything <span>minimalist</span>. I find that the simplest looking designs belie the thought behind them. For most of my work, I use Google's <span>Material Design</span> as a base and add new styles to my personal <span>SASS</span> framework.</p>
            <h4 class="section-subheading">Goal</h4>
            <p class="section-text">For me, the next step of flat design is <span>texturized</span> flat + animations. I'm very much influnced by video games, and I hope to create experiences that are as intuitive and playful as those of well-made video games.</p>
            <h4 class="section-subheading">Misc.</h4>
            <p class="section-text">As many of our decisions are made based on <span>emotion</span>, I hope to create designs that evoke certain emotions appropriate for the task.</p>
